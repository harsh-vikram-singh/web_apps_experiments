# Introduction
This repository holds the code for my learning process fo building web apps that can serve deep learning models.
The inspiration for this is the fastai deep learning course. The models created and trained during this process
would be served through these apps.

## Plan

1. Learn to build a Flask and Django app
2. An app using Starlette framework
